      <description>Last Friday, a couple of my colleagues were cleaning up old issues in Github, and I decided to go through the issues I had filed and close out all of the ones that I didn&amp;rsquo;t think made sense to keep. I started with 178 open issues authored by me; at the end I had only 12.
Of the issues I closed, some were outdated, no longer relevant, or superseded by other planned work.</description>

      <title>Starting a Blog</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried starting a blog a couple of times before, using platforms like Google Blogs or Wordpress. Every time before I would write maybe a couple of posts, then get bored or forget about it and stop writing. I&amp;rsquo;m trying again, using my own static site this time. The goal this time is to give myself a place to record thoughts while also hopefully also learning a little bit about making a static site (since I&amp;rsquo;ve always been strictly a backend developer).</description>
