I've tried starting a blog a couple of times before, using platforms like
Google Blogs or Wordpress. Every time before I would write maybe a couple of posts,
then get bored or forget about it and stop writing. I'm trying again, using my own
static site this time. The goal this time is to give myself a place to record thoughts
while also hopefully also learning a little bit about making a static site (since
I've always been strictly a backend developer).

We'll see how it goes - maybe I won't post very often, but I don't want this to be
another attempt that falls away after a couple of posts. I'll probably keep most of them
brief, so the barrier to writing isn't high. Right now my plan is to only write about
things related to work; I'm not promising to stick to that theme strictly, but I
expect it to drive a lot of the content I add.
